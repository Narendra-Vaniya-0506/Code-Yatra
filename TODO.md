# TODO List for Fixing Profile Navigation Issue

## Tasks
- [x] Update Dashboard.js to use useNavigate instead of window.location.href for profile button
- [x] Confirm Profile.js useEffect logic for authentication check
- [ ] Test navigation from dashboard to profile to ensure no redirect to login

## Progress
- [x] Analyzed the issue: Profile button uses window.location.href causing page reload and potential auth state loss
- [x] Identified solution: Use react-router's useNavigate for SPA navigation
- [x] Confirmed Profile.js useEffect waits for loading before redirecting
