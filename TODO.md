# 3D Effects Implementation for Lesson Hero Section

## Completed Tasks

### âœ… Updated `src/pages/Lessons/lessons.css`
- Added 3D transition effects to `.lesson-hero` class
- Implemented smooth animations with `transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease`
- Added initial box shadow for floating effect: `0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 2px 4px -2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`
- Enhanced hover effects with transform: `translateY(-5px)` for lift effect
- Increased shadow on hover for enhanced 3D appearance: `0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 4px 6px -2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`

## Features Implemented

1. **Smooth Transitions**: 0.3s ease transitions for both transform and box-shadow properties
2. **Floating Effect**: Initial subtle shadow creates a 3D floating appearance
3. **Hover Interaction**: Element lifts up by 5px when hovered
4. **Enhanced Shadow**: Shadow becomes more pronounced on hover to emphasize the 3D effect
5. **Preserved Existing Styling**: All original styling (padding, colors, borders, etc.) remains intact

## Testing
The 3D effects will be visible on any page using the `.lesson-hero` class, including the Python Lessons page. Hover over the hero section to see the interactive 3D effect.

## Files Affected
- `src/pages/Lessons/lessons.css` - Updated with 3D effects
- All lesson pages using `.lesson-hero` class will automatically inherit the new styling
